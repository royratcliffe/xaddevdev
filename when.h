 * \brief Whenever something happens, do what.
 * \details This macro defines a function that is called when a specific event
 * occurs. It is used to register a callback function that will be executed when
 * the specified event occurs. The function is placed in a specific section of
 * the binary, allowing it to be discovered and executed at runtime.
 *
 * By design, the macro requires a semicolon at the end of the CAUSES macro
 * invocation to ensure that the function definition is correctly terminated and
 * to allow for multiple invocations of the CAUSES macro without syntax errors.
 * This design choice allows for a clean and consistent way to register multiple
 * callbacks for the same event without needing to worry about the underlying
 * section management, as the linker will handle the placement of the functions
 * in memory. The semicolon also helps to visually separate different callback
 * registrations in the code, improving readability.
 *
 * \param _when_ The name of the event that triggers the callback.
 * \param _what_ The name of the function to be called when the event occurs.

/*
 * The TASKING compiler concatenates the section name with the function name to
 * create a unique section for each callback, but it does not adjust the section
 * end marker (_lc_ue_) to account for multiple callbacks in the same section.
 *
 * Use the same section name for all callbacks of the same event, and rely on
 * the linker to place them contiguously in memory. The CAUSES macro defines a
 * function with the specified name and places it in the appropriate section,
 * allowing multiple callbacks for the same event to be registered without
 * conflicts. The OCCURS macro then iterates over all callbacks in that section
 * when the event occurs, ensuring that all registered functions are called.
 *
 * The .sdecl directive is used to declare the section in assembly language, and
 * the .word directive is used to place the address of the callback function in
 * the section; the .sect directive is used to select the section. The
 * __attribute__((used)) ensures that the function is not optimised away by the
 * compiler, even if it appears to be unused in the code.

 * \brief When something happened, do something with it.

 * to register multiple handlers for the same event, enabling flexible and extensible
 * event handling.
 *
 * The implementation iterates over all registered callback functions for the
 * specified event and calls each one with the provided argument.
 *
 * For the TASKING compiler, the `_lc_ub_` and `_lc_ue_` prefixes mark the start and
 * end of the callback list for the event. The `extern` declarations make the function
 * pointers visible across translation units for correct linker resolution.

 * of the callback list for the event.

 * \param ... The arguments to be passed to the callback function when the
